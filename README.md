# My Summer Car Additional Controls

MSC Additional Controls is a mod that adds new bindable controls to My Summer Car. This lets the player bind actions like starting a car to a game controller.

**NOTE:** This is originally developed for a custom sim racer button box, and may not work that well with generic game controllers. If you wish to develop the mod further into a more generic control mod, feel free to fork the repo or submit pull requests.

## Dependencies

The mod requires that MSC Mod Loader is installed: https://github.com/piotrulos/MSCModLoader

The mod is developer for MSCLoader version 1.1.16, but will most likely work with other recent versions.

## Currently supported functions

* Satsuma
  * Start key (power off/ACC/start engine)
  * Choke on/off
  * Light mode (off/on/high beam)
